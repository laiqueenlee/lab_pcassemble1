Self-improvement:
- I should participate more actively in our group lab work when it comes to hand-ons. Avoid passive learning.
- I should communicate with group members more to ensure everybody got to do the lab work and understand every step.
- I should listen to the lecturer more carefully and voice out my question immediately to avoid taking risks while handling delicate hardware components.
